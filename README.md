#NodeJS API

##Setting up:
1. Of course install the latest version of NodeJS from [NodeJS web site] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once installed NodeJS (and of course npm), go to the folder where you want to start your project and open a command line.
2. Install express generator (it's a scaffolding app that creates a skeleton for express-driven sites)

`C:\node>npm install -g express-generator`

 It should already be available in your system path.
